Typically presented in a tabular format, a leaderboard allows users to easily identify and compare the top performers or leaders in a given field. Commonly used in gaming, sports, and various online platforms, leaderboards serve as a motivational tool, fostering healthy competition and encouraging participants to strive for excellence to attain higher positions on the list. The criteria for ranking can vary widely, ranging from points earned, completion times, or any other measurable metrics relevant to the particular context of the leaderboard.
